# Java_Projects_ASU
Contains several projects that I thought were interesting from my education. Bank Application is a system that holds several bank accounts and can perform several actions on them, FoodBills are kind of like the apps servers use on their tablets (did this to mess with GUIs),
Enhanced FoodBill is much better and prettier than foodbill, textReader kinda works like word's functionality of reading characters and words. Recursive solutions include several solutions including an interesting triangle area problem,
Scrabble is a program messing with data structures.
